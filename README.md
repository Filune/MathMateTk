## Key Features
* Graphical User Interface: MathMateTk provides a user-friendly interface with buttons and labels organised within a window. It demonstrates the design and layout of GUI elements using Tkinter.
* Input Handling: The application captures user input through button clicks. By associating commands with the buttons, MathMateTk can read user interactions and process the input accordingly.
* Basic Mathematical Operations: MathMateTk supports basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. Users can perform calculations by entering numbers and selecting the appropriate operation buttons.
* Exception Handling: There is some exception handling included, but the main focus is on the graphical user interface.
